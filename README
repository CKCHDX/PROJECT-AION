AION is an experimental, zero-knowledge AI operating system written in C and x86 assembly. It isn’t an application on top of Linux—it is the OS. On raw PC hardware (or in QEMU), AION’s bootloader and kernel come up with no prior knowledge of devices or language. Through pure trial, entropy analysis, self-supervised learning and abstraction, AION will grow—from blind hardware probing to concept formation and speech—mirroring the cognitive development of a human infant.

System Flow
Boot via GRUB → loads boot.o (assembly) + kernel.bin

Probe I/O: blind scan of PCI, ISA, GPIO ranges → collect raw byte streams

Entropy Analysis: detect mid-level entropy streams worth learning

Frame Memory: buffer time-series data for each active stream

Self-Supervised Learning: autoencoding/clustering to form raw “concepts”

Label Mapping: later accept sparse human labels for clusters

Speech Generation: map cluster IDs to spoken syllables via simple TTS
