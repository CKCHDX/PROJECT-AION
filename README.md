# PROJECT-AION
PROJECT-AION is an initiative to develop a new architecture for artificial intelligence. The goal is to create a self-learning AI designed to function as an operating system. AION will be integrated directly into hardware, enabling it to autonomously explore and learn within a strictly controlled environment. To ensure safety and stability, the system will operate without internet access or any form of external control that could compromise its integrity.
